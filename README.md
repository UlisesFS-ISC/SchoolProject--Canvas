# SchoolProject--Canvas
School project with HTML5 Canvas that graphs sine and cosine functions and more.
StandAlone Graph html file displays the canvas itself without having to go through the application itself.
When provided with a file with an array of coordinates to print, it will print all the points in the graph and will show
the results of putting every coordinate given through a LaGrange sine function aproximation.
